We have a strong preference for a development stack that includes Flask, AWS, PostgreSQL, and a front end JavaScript framework like React or Angular. You should also be a team player with a knack for visual design and familiarity with Agile approaches to software development.</p>
    <p>This role will be focused on effectively transitioning engineering practices at MSF-USA into an innovation-focused one though R&D and production-grade products. This transition will also require balancing new projects with existing maintained infrastructure. In both cases, having flexibility, assuming ownership and working iteratively on deliverables will be key to overall success.</p>
