<h4 >What will you do ?</h4><br>
<p>Thanks to our industry leading operations, science and commercial teams, UNDO is already at the forefront of carbon removal – pioneering the development of Enhanced Rock Weathering as an affordable, highly scalable approach that has the ability to comprise a major part of the solution we need to tackle climate change. Now we are building out an agile, fast moving tech team who can deliver the technology required to support the business as it scales, and that will underpin the next stages of the company’s growth.

    As part of that we are looking for passionate, versatile and talented Software Engineers across a range of disciplines and a range of experience levels: from mid-level engineers through to future heads of engineering. Some of the solutions that we’re building out and the likely technologies involved include</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A SaaS platform for Enhanced Rock Weathering project developers to plan and manage operations worldwide</li><br>
        <li>A Carbon Inventory Management system + Web App </li><br>
        <li>Computational modelling for accurately predicting future Carbon Sequestration.</li><br>
        <li>E-commerce offerings and a secure client portal </li><br>
        <li>Integration and analysis of field data from IoT devices.</li><br>
    </ul>

<br>
<h4>Qualifications</h4><br>

<ul>
    <li>You’re experienced at deploying and maintaining production quality solutions in the cloud and are skilled in modern development practises including DevOps and CI/CD. But you also embrace LEAN principles, the concept of MVP and “just good enough”.</li><br>
    <li>You are an adept problem solver with a growth mindset. You aren’t phased by technical challenges that you haven’t faced before, or that cannot be solved with the existing tools in your toolkit. You back yourself to ramp-up fast and find practical solutions.</li><br>
    <li>Whilst skilled at writing code and employing traditional development and test practises, you are also a pragmatist -- equally happy to embrace and adapt existing solutions where they are already available.</li><br>
    <li>You keep up to date with emerging technologies and are able to ramp up quickly and apply these when they are a good solution for the problem at hand.</li><br>
    <li>You have great communication skills and work well as a member of a collaborative, agile team, bringing value to the team beyond your pure technical skills. You are comfortable in a rapidly changing, dynamic environment where the needs of your consumers are constantly evolving.</li><br>
</ul>
